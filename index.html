    <p>Hi! My name is Peter Hwang. I am currently a 4th year at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Marketing Analytics. I'm originally
        from the Seattle area, but I have really enjoyed my time here in Boston! Some of the things I like are eating good food, playing music, and 
        going on adventures with my friends. 
    </p>

    <p> Here are some things you can expect that will be to this website soon:</p>

    <ul> 
      <li>Hobbies (more in depth!)</li>
      <li>Academic and Professional Works</li>
      <li>Gallery of Photos!</li>
    </ul>
